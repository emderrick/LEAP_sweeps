The first thing I did was with the whole-genome sequences of the original spike-in bacteria.
I assembled the raw fastq reads using spades 
I submitted this to the queue because it is RAM heavy.

#!/usr/bin/bash
for file in *R1.fastq*
do
filetwo="${file//R1.fastq/R2.fastq}"
out="${file//R1.fastq/spadesoutput}"
spades.py -o $out -1 $file -2 $filetwo --isolate
done
